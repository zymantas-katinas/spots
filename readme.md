Â # Spots.lt web project

This was my final project at Vilnius Coding School web development Bootcamp.

The idea of the website is to share the best places to work in town as a freelancer, whether it is a cafe or a co-working space. The project is still in the development version.

## Tools used:

JavaScript, WordPress, Php, HTML, BEM, Sass, FlexBox, Google Maps API
