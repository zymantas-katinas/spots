# [Spots.lt](http://spots.lt/) web project

This was my final project at [Vilnius Coding School](https://www.vilniuscoding.lt/) web development Bootcamp.

The idea of the website is to share the best places to work in town as a freelancer, whether it is a cafe or a co-working space. The project is still in the development version. 

For this website, I have created a design template as well as code from scratch. Its content is managed with WordPress.

## Tools used:

*JavaScript, WordPress, Php, HTML, BEM, Sass, FlexBox, Google Maps API, Adobe Photoshop*
